## Strategy Tips

1. **Keep Moving** - Standing still is death. Constantly circle-strafe enemies.

2. **Use Walls** - Ricochet spells can hit enemies from unexpected angles.

3. **Crowd Control** - Save explosive spells for when enemies cluster.

4. **Mutation Synergy** - Combine mutations for powerful effects:
   - Rapid Fire + Chaos Storm = Spell spam
   - Explosive Finale + Spell Size = Massive AoE
   - Ricochet Master + Volatile Magic = Chaos everywhere

5. **Enemy Priority** - Kill shooters first, they're the most dangerous.

6. **Learn Behaviors** - Enemies switch between chase, circle, and dodge. Predict their movements.

7. **Arena Awareness** - Keep track of hazards and use arena rotation to your advantage.

## Scoring
- **100 points** per enemy killed
- **Wave bonus** = Wave number × 100
- Try to beat your high score!

## Visual Indicators
- **Player glow** - Cyan when normal, white + flashing when invulnerable
- **Health bar** - Green above 50%, yellow above 25%, red below
- **Spell trails** - Colored trails show spell paths
- **Particles** - Explosions and impacts create particle effects
- **Enemy health bars** - Shows remaining health above each enemy

## Advanced Techniques

### Kiting
Move in large circles around the arena to keep distance from melee enemies while focusing fire on shooters.

### Spell Leading
Aim where enemies will be, not where they are. Predict their movement patterns.

### Wall Bouncing
Position yourself so ricochet spells bounce from walls into enemy groups.

### Mutation Stacking
Some mutations can be selected multiple times (Rapid Fire, Speed Demon, Shield Burst) for compounding effects.

### Invulnerability Frames
You have brief invulnerability after taking damage. Use it to escape dangerous situations.

## Good luck, and may chaos favor you!
